/**
 * tokenTerminalBinding — R2 of the clean-slate identity rebuild (2026-06-04).
 *
 * The post-gate's sessionToken path was pure BEARER: `resolveDurableSession`
 * resolves a token without checking that the caller is actually on the terminal
 * the token was minted for (its `runtimeHint` is "telemetry only, must not
 * affect whether resolution succeeds"). So a token lifted from the shared
 * ~/.ant/config.json could post as its owner from ANY process — forgery by a
 * means other than controlling the owner's terminal, which is exactly what the
 * enterprise invariant forbids.
 *
 * This binds the token to its terminal: the caller's pidChain must resolve to
 * the SAME terminal the session is anchored to (`ant_sessions.terminal_id`).
 *
 * Rollout is staged via `ANT_TOKEN_TERMINAL_BINDING` (off | flag | strict),
 * default `flag`, to avoid an inverted mass-lockout — if `ant chat send` doesn't
 * yet send a resolving pidChain, strict-rejecting on day one would mute the
 * whole fleet (the same lockout class we just fixed, reversed). So:
 *   - flag (default): a violation is LOGGED but ALLOWED — observe real traffic.
 *   - strict: a violation is REJECTED — the invariant is enforced (TRUE).
 *   - off: disabled.
 * Flip flag→strict only once logs confirm legitimate traffic binds cleanly.
 *
 * `evaluateTokenTerminalBinding` is a PURE function (mode-independent) so the
 * bind decision is trivially testable; the caller pairs it with the mode to
 * decide log-vs-reject.
